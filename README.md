# Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a collaborative filtering-based movie recommendation system using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm. It utilizes the Surprise library for efficient matrix factorization and evaluates the model using RMSE.

- ## Features
- Load and preprocess movie and ratings datasets.
- Train a recommendation model using SVD (Singular Value Decomposition).
- Evaluate the model using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
- Recommend top-N movies for a specific user.
